4,"Received the phone today. Thanks to Flipkart was super fast delivery. Ordered the yellow colour for my mom because it appeared classy. Inside the box, we had the phone, adaptor, case and original bill.  Well, i have two things to say. Yes, the handset actually looks good to the eyes and feels premium in hand. Battery is very good. I could see the phone charging up to 100% within 30 minutes and i used the phone throughout the day and it's still on 51%. Camera is Decent enough to make you cap...READ MORE"
4,Although it is a alrounder 5G phone in specs but the camera quality didn't satisfied me even not a decent 64 MP sensor peromance slow down due to the processor battery life is better and with 67 vault its a nice combination and the best part of the phone is its display i liked the display very much because its has 1200 nits peak brightness with 120htz refresh rate and 360 touch sampling its a best super amoled dispaly phone you can go for this if you can compromise with camera otherwise if wa...READ MORE
3,"Specifications are only great on papers, 64mp camera doesn't fill like 64mp at all ... Work like 12mp camera. Performance is just OK, display also just above average and doesn't fill like 120hz refresh rate. Very average phone for this price. So OK you can go for it but not really value for money phone or as you expect a POCO phone.READ MORE"
5,"Guys this is the best true amoled display other makers are fooling people's telling amoled but this is real amoled colors are punchy and display is bright enough just go for this multimedia, gaming purpose it's a treat... I never posted reviews in my life this is the first time.. Touch responsive is super... But one thing go for 128gb variant instead of 64 because os took 20gb remaining only 40 gb available. Thank youREAD MORE"
3,"Camera is very bad , even a 12000 phone has a better camera tha this device  4k is not supported  for multimedia not even in  video recording thats the downgrade  Pros:-.   Battery is good  Fast charging is fine  Display is niceREAD MORE"
5,"The phone is value for money.The display is in league above the rest in this range.Processor is also good for the price range.2 seperate speakers and it gets loud and clear no distortion at high volume.Charging time is great even when compared to flagship phones.The only con for the phone is camera. It's really low quality even in this range.If your not into photography this is the best phone in the range, but if you prioritise camera this phone is not for you.READ MORE"
4,Camera is fine.. But gamer it's little in comfortable because of head set 3.5 jack given top of the phone so while playing it distrub. Wireless is fine. Battery average. Display good in 120 hetz.READ MORE
3,Camera is very bad in this price segment. Realme cameras are much betterDisplay and sound quality is awesome.Performance is good but I felt like I was not getting 60 fps in cod mobile. There is also ram management issue. Battery is good. 67 watt charger does it work. But if use in 120 fps battery drops quite fastREAD MORE
5,Stunning looks and performance was good decent sound quality only one con please improve cam optionsREAD MORE
4,"Phone's best part is its  body finish,stereo speakers and display...Phone fails to keep its promise of 60w fast charging,on average it takes one hour plus to charge upto 100 percent.Camera is average.Needs software fixes..Phone has two gigs of extended ram or virtual ram that makes it 8 gb ram too at the same time...Go for 128gb as 30 gigs is kept reserved by phones and softwares.Phone is not a bad deal,we can't have everything in our dish.So not disappointed with it as overall but it feel ba...READ MORE"

4,"If you are searching for all rounder phone then go for it. I am giving the review after using for a week. Pros-Looks is just awesome. Samoled touch is like a butter. 120hz refresh rate does its work well, can be changed to 60hz when travelling as 120hz refresh rate consume battery.

5,"All rounder smartphone and decent performance but you cant expect that kind of camera performance of poco x3. Still great option in this price segment as 67 watt charger in the box, super amoled display., and Snapdragon 695 5g processor.READ MORE"
3,"Released with less specification than expected like instead of 108MP, its with 64MP.Processor could have been on higher side instead of Snapdragon 695, it could have been 7xx, 8xx.Pros:Camera quality is still good in light, not great in dark though but fine enough.Due to 120HZ refresh rate, touch responses are pretty quick.Lookwise premium look.Feels somewhat bulky and heavy a bit.Charging is faster due to high Watt charger support, with heavy usage full charging lasts for more than a...READ MORE"

3,"This phone is a mid-range performance based device, with great display, good speakers, 3.5 mm audio jack (a necessity for any audiophile), and good battery backup.The camera module is just pathetic to say the least.I'm not into gaming so won't be discussing gaming in this review at all. Performance wise, multitasking is great, aggressive RAM management can be turned on and off for apps, so, one can keep apps in volatile memory according to one's needs. Speakers and 3.5 mm audio jack are g...READ MORE"
4,My honest review after 10 days => Back design is awesome but camera back is bulky=> Display is very nice => good processor but not much good for gamers if you are gamer don't buy this one => Camera is good but less than my expectations=> Case quality is brilliant => Other features are also nice => charger is very fast (67W) as In starting it can charge phone fully around 40min but after a week of usage it may take 1hour as other smartphone do Overall:If you are gamer than don't buy t...READ MORE

5,Nice display. Long battery life with fast charging.  64MP camera giving superb photos and videos. Superb product at this price range with stereo speakers. I hope poco  will give more advanced featured phone with reasonable price in future. Android 12 should follow early to keep it up to dateREAD MORE
4,Mobile using very smooth and easy display and camera very good. But over all i am not using the mobile. So I can not reply another details. Specification is good.snapdragon is 695 can give more and 740 snapdragon satisfy. Over all mobile goodREAD MORE
4,Excellent product for this price but I have some call drop related problem on this phone. Also it is bulky for daily use.Battery performance with fast charging is excellent camera is also decent but videography is not upto mark also MIUI experience is good with no junk apps and less bugs.READ MORE
3,"Display is not vibrant I can see sand like pixels. Camera quality is very poor, really very very poor. MiUi lags many times for example 1. While installing app, screen blinks sometimes 2. Scroll up scroll down is not smooth like I'm using 6gb ram (+2gb virtual ram) 3. Typing sync mismatch. The biggest problem I am facing daily are mic that does not work while loud speaker on and the Proximity sensor, that stopped working after just 15 to 20days.Battery backup is ok for me as I don't p...READ MORE"
5,"The phone is great. Its a great value option for people who dont expect high end performance and gaming. Gives to decent yet powerful experience in performing the regular tasks. Camera could be better. Not an Hardware issue I guess, just the POCO team could provide with some OTA updates. Screen and speakers are a good combo. Great for multimedia consumption. In short: Good for the price. In 2022 the mid range market is full of expensive yet mediocre devices, where POCO tries to do a balancing...READ MORE"

3,A good smartphone for everyday use but you have to compromise in camera segment. primary camera in this range was expected to be much better. lack of 4k and 60fps support is biggest downside in this range. no night mode in ultrawide and front camera  front camera was very noisy even in day light. display was good enough and bright. battery backup was superb. poco x4 is not for camera usersREAD MORE
